## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student at Pennsylvania State University, in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/), where I am advised by [Dr. James Z. Wang](https://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml). My broad area of research interest is _multimodal AI_, with a focus on _improving abtract, subjective reasoning capabilities_ in multimodal AI models - such as _emotional, cultural, or social understanding_. At present, I am working on the following (and/or asking the following research questions): 

- Can we model and automatically predict what emotions are expressed through body language/gestures? 
- Using theories from cognitive science and neuroscience to better inform model design for emotion understanding.
- What are some general improvements in VLMs that can enhance their capabilities in a wide range of subjective reasoning tasks (eg., personality alignment, etc.)?
- How can we predict the memorability of some content? (In collaboration with Dr. Yaman K. Singla, and Somesh Singh from Adobe MDSR Labs, India)

Prior to joining my PhD, I was a Software Engineer at [Microsoft, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/), working with Azure storage. I graduated with a B.Tech. in Computer Science from IIEST Shibpur in 2022. 

As an undergraduate student, I was fortunate to have been advised by [Prof. Chris Biemann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html) at the University of Hamburg, for my internship as a DAAD WISE Scholar. I worked on improving lexical resources for low-resource languages during this internship, where I also closely worked with [Dr. Abhik Jana](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile.php/abhik/). For my undergraduate thesis at IIEST, I worked on applications of graph learning, and explored areas like medical diagnosis using GNNs, and social network analysis.

Besides academics, I love music in any and every form. I trained in Indian classical and folk music vocals for almost 2 decades, often performing professionally in India. I also enjoy theatre, and was part of a professional group for over 6 years. These days, I am learning how to play the piano, and trying to understand Western classical music (with the distant dream of performing in a musical someday!). I enjoy trying to play tennis (which I am extremely bad at!), and am also learning to swim.
