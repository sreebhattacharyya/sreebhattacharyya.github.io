## About Me

I am a PhD student at Pennsylvania State University, in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/). I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Wang Group](https://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml). My current research areas of interest are related to multimodal AI, with a focus on applications in Affective Computing. 

Prior to joining my PhD, I was a Software Engineer at [Microsoft, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/), working with Azure storage. I graduated with a B.Tech. in Computer Science from IIEST Shibpur in 2022. 

As an undergraduate student, I was fortunate to have been advised by [Prof. Chris Biemann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html) at the University of Hamburg, for my internship as a DAAD WISE Scholar. I worked on improving lexical resources for low-resource languages during this internship, where I was also closely advised by [Dr. Abhik Jana](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile.php/abhik/). For my undergraduate thesis at IIEST, I worked on applications of graph learning, and explored areas like medical diagnosis using GNNs, and social network analysis.

## Research Interests

- **Affective Computing:** emotion modeling, context modeling for emotion recognition
- **Multimodal AI:** applications in affective computing that use vision, language and speech
- **Natural Language Processing:** Multilingual NLP with applications in building technologies for lesser-resourced languages
